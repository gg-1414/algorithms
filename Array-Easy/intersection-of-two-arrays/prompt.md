## Intersection Of Two Arrays

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.

### Example 1:

- Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
- Output: [2,2]

### Example 2:

- Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
- Output: [4,9]

### Example 3:

- Input: nums1 = [5,3,8,1], nums2 = [9,1,2,3,8]
- Output: [3,8,1] or [1,3,8] or [8,1,3]
